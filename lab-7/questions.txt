1. Write a menu driven program for performing stack operations such a PUSH, POP,
finding top of the stack.
2. Implement stack operations as in program 1 using singly linked list instead of array.
3. Write a C Program to implement Queue using an array. The program should be
menu-driven, with the option to enqueue, and dequeue, to check whether the queue is
empty or full, traverse, and exit based on the user's choice.
4. Write a C Program to implement Circular Queue using an array. The program should be
menu-driven, with the option to enqueue, and dequeue, to check whether the queue is
empty or full, traverse, and exit based on the user's choice.
5. Implement Circular Queue and perform operations on it using doubly circular linked list
instead of array.
